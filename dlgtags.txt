Dialog Tags:
------------

	Tags are keywords inclosed in [] brackets.  Tags are used to display
	game information such as object prices, player names, etc.
	
	To allow the script programmer to use brackets in his dialog lines, 
	the tags "[[" and "[]" translate to the characters "[" and "]" 
	respectively.

Dialog lines follow the format below

	"This is dialog [tag] this is more dialog [[ [] these are brackets"

Where, if the value of the tag was "Ima Tag" the line would display as...

	"This is dialog Ima Tag this is more dialog [ ] these are brackets"

The '+' modifier can be used to add a '+ sign to positive numbers.  This
is useful for showing stats of weapons.

	"Weapon modifier is [+damage]"

If damage is negative, it will show

	"Weapon modifier is -3"

If the damage is positive, it will show

	"Weapon modifier is +2"


Current Object Tag:
-------------------

The current object can be set using the <> characters.  Once the current
object is set, all other tags refer to it.

	"<Flaming Sword> Buy a [name] for [price] with [+damage] damage"


Special Current Object Tags:

	<me>		The current player character
	<you>		Who we are currently talking to
	<this>		The current object

Note that these are the same tags


List of Tags:
-------------

	[chr]	The name of the players character (normally "Locke")
	[to]	The name of the player you are talking to
	[obj]	The name of the current object
